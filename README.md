### Summary ###

This POC project specifically created to demonstrates the following concepts:

* Project structure with dependency injection and avoiding coupling
* Custom Actor Model of Concurrency implementation
* High data throughput to allow for processing and enriching data at scale
* Leveraging Chat GPT API to enrich data/transform data

### How it Works! ###




### Limitations ###

Hacked together over a Sunday hence far from ideal:

* Test coverage could be significantly better
* Many shortcuts taken i.e. `TODO` comments explaining how code could be improved
* Missing CI/CD
